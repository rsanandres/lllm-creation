# AI Agent Development

This module focuses on building intelligent AI agents that can assist customers in selecting and purchasing servers based on their requirements.

## Key Concepts

1. **Agent Architecture**
   - State management
   - Decision-making logic
   - Task automation
   - Context awareness

2. **Integration Components**
   - Database connectivity
   - Recommendation engine
   - Decision pipeline
   - User interaction handling

3. **Agent Capabilities**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Contextual reasoning
   - Task planning
   - Error handling and recovery

## Project Integration

This module connects with:
- **LLM RAG Practice**: For natural language understanding
- **Search & Retrieval**: For product search
- **Database Design**: For data management
- **Backend API**: For system integration

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   export DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
   ```

3. Start with `basic_agent_framework.py` to understand agent architecture

4. Progress through the exercises in order

## Best Practices

1. Implement proper state management
2. Use async operations for better performance
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Monitor agent performance
5. Use proper logging
6. Implement security measures
7. Regular testing and validation

## Next Steps

After completing this module, you should:
1. Understand how to build intelligent agents
2. Be comfortable with agent architecture
3. Know how to integrate with various systems
4. Be able to implement complex decision-making logic
